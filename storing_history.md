Saving the CONVERSATION HISTORY:
The chatbot must create a (:Response) node that contains the original input, the rephrased question, and the output from the LLM.

As users receive one or more responses within a session, this forms a natural hierarchy of (:Session) nodes, each containing relationships to many (:Response) nodes.

Regardless of which chain creates it, the (:Response) node should hold the following properties:

.createdAt - The creation date of the node

.input - The original input that comes from the user

.rephrasedQuestion - The standalone question rephrased by the LLM using the conversation history

.output - The output subsequently generated by the LLM following the RAG stage
